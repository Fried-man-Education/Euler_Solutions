# Project Euler Solutions
### About
This repo was created for educational purposes. It serves as a collection for the various solutions to the problems presented in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). The idea is to have each programmer specialize in answering the problems in a programming language they arent used to and to have others who are more proficient help them out when they are stuck. Each problem will be housed in its own folder where every contributor submits a solution in their language of choice.
